# DISK-O
`DISK-O` is a disk management application. The current goals for this application are:
1. Able to provide basic operations of a directories (we will call it filesystem from now as that sounds rather cool)
   that this application is managing.
    * Create files -> upload operation
    * Delete files
    * Read files -> download
    * Update -> upload file
3. Provide a UI that should be able to browse the filesystem being managed
4. Provide Auth features (backend and UI)
5. Provide some metadata information related to the filesystem
